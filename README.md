## Alien Invasion Game (python)

**_Alien Invasion_** - its a arcade game from "Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes" book.
I implemented this project to improve my skills.

## Intriduction

In order to start the game, you need to run the file alien_invasion.py. The game starts with the ship in the center at the bottom of the screen.
An enemy fleet of aliens appears at the top of the screen, in which the player must shoot. 
As soon as the enemy fleet is destroyed, the level of the game will rise and the aliens will begin to move faster.
If aliens fly up to the player's ship, one ship is lost. 
Initially, the player has three attempts to destroy all enemy ships.

## Controls

**_Space-bar_** - fire
**_Arrows keys_** (left/right) - move the ship left/right
